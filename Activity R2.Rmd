## Exploring Cars

In this R markdown document I will **explore** the built in *dataset* mtcars.

```{r mtcars}
summary(mtcars)
```

## I can also make a table to compare different mtcars
```{r echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[10:15, ])
```


## Guess I could do a plot to...
```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(mtcars$mpg)
```

Here is a list
```{r}
my_list <- list("this", "list", "contains", 5, "things")
for (item in my_list) {
  print(item)
}
```
